## At [Edinburgh Winter 2024](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/EdinburghWinter2024)
## I broke my 3:49.75 single on the very first attempt with a 2:15.94 and my second attempt was 2:26.00 but sadly fell off on the third, getting no mean :(
## Later on in the final I DNF'd first and third but got PR of 2:08.17 on the second :333
